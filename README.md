1. keeping organised throughout my course is what motivated me throughout assignment #5. Creating a day planner that helps you scheduel your day out is a big benefit to planning out days in order to get everything important done.

2.This project was bulit to haelp with timemanagemnt, studying and having a busy lifestyle can become overwhealming . Having a day planner can ease the stress knowing what needs to be done ensuring nothing is missed.

3.With using a day planner to keep organised it solves the problem of forgetting what needs to be done for the day and at what time. It stops work from pieling up and leaving you less stresed and satisfied when everything is complete.
